## General info
Purpose of the project was to learn how to analyse the data and make my first analysis. The goal has been achieved. 
The project contains two analysis. Diabetes_1 is the first one and the result is satisfying. Diabetes_2 is the second one and it is based on the first. I wanted to compare what happens if I remove two columns with poor quality data from the dataset. 

## Technologies
* Jupyter Notebook - version 6.2.0
* Python 3 - version 3.9.0
* Pandas - version 1.2.3
* NumPy - version 1.20.1
* Scikit-learn - version 0.24.1
* Matplotlib - version 3.3.4
* Seaborn - version 0.11.1

## Setup
You need to have Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer to see the analysis.

## Status
Notebook diabetes_1 - finished in 2021, my first attempt to make a data analysis and model testing project.
Notebook diabetes_2 - same as diabetes_1 but working on data with excluded nans. In conclusion there is a comparison to diabetes_1.
Notebook diabetes_3 - under development. I want to add enhancement - check performance of other algorithms instead of only KNN, as well as make better vizualisations. 

## Inspiration
As I have a risk to suffer in the future from diabetes it is interesting topic for me. When I found the database on Kaggle, I immediately knew that I would like to analyse this dataset.
