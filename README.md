## Chocolate_bars
Project actually (September 2024) finished. I found this project on DataCamp website, but also checked on Kaggle where I found the dataset. Interesting for me, a huge chocolate enthousiast. 

## Diabetes
Diabetes analysis I made for the end of the workshop from Women In Technology Poland I participated in March 2021. It needs to be updated to check if k-means algorithm will perform better than used KNN algorithm. In addition there is a need to change visualizations.

## Health_analysis
Project actually (June 2024) under development. I find interesting connection between health statictics and the possibility of getting a civilization disease such as diabetes. Can we somehow prevent it? 

## Lego_Bricks
Project to somehow analyze Lego bricks. Under development.
