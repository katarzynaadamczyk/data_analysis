## Chocolate_bars
Project actually (September 2024) finished. I found this project on DataCamp website, but also checked on Kaggle where I found the dataset. Interesting for me, a huge chocolate enthousiast. 

## Diabetes
Diabetes analysis I made for the end of the workshop from Women In Technology Poland I participated in March 2021. Updated in January 2025, file diabetes_3 is the actual version. It compares behaviour of different algorithms (KNN, Decision Tree, KMeans) on input data. Data itself is also in two versions.

## Health_analysis
Project actually (January 2025) under development. I find interesting connection between health statictics and the possibility of getting a civilization disease such as diabetes. Can we somehow prevent it? 

## Lego_Bricks
Project to somehow analyze Lego bricks. Under development.
